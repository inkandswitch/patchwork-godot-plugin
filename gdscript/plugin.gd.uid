Right, so currently the implementation for checking file changes is quite bad because it's very inefficient. Unfortunately there is no event that gives me exactly like which file changed. So what I need to do is scan all the files to figure out if the file actually changed or not. What I want you to do is instead of comparing the content of the files, generating a hash.
